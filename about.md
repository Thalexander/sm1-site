We are working with Microsoft as part of an industrial collaboration by
University College London to help further develop the Spot Market proof 
of concept which is a joint collaboration between Microsoft and Kent County 
Council. Spot MArket aims to regenerate the High Street by providing
a beneficial service for consumers and retailers, helping connect them using
machine learning.

Our role is to utilise Microsoft technologies such as Cortana Intelligence
Suite and Microsoft Bot Framework to provide recommendations from the Spot 
Market engine to individuals without the need to install an app.

To keep the project organised and all stakeholders updated we are producing 
biweekly reports and have created a MoSCoW analysis that defines what we are creating.
To understand what would best suit the users of the service we will also be
carrying out a number of experiments to see how different interfaces work
for this project and when we get to the actual development work we intend to 
follow an Agile style workflow using Visual Studio Team Services.

MoSCoW Analysis
---------------
#### Must Have

- The bot must get the user's location
- The bot must provide appropriate recommendations based on user's input

#### Should Have
- The bot should get the user's data to interface with the recommendation engine
- The bot should take into account user response to suggestions
- The bot should not require the installation of a client app
- The bot should be deployable on popular messaging platforms
- The bot should be able to narrow down and present the user the most appropriate suggestions based on the results returned by the recommendation engine

#### Could have
- The bot could be energy efficient
- The bot could be aesthetically pleasing
- The bot could recommend promotions and products in the vicinity of the user
- The bot could allow for discovery of new places when requested by the user
