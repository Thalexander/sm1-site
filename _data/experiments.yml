  functions:
    - title: "In order to provide recommendations based on location, the location of the user will need to be extracted either from the text using NLP or possibly from the channel using platform specific features"
    - title: "The message will be processed using the LUIS language understanding model to extract the intent and entities"
    - title: "A query for the Spot Market engine's REST API will be created using these components"
    - title: "Having received a response from the Spot Market engine for the query the results will now need to be formatted as a reply to the user in a natural language style, and possibly using carousels or action buttons depending on the response"
  tests:
    - title: "The bot will get the location of the user (if supported)"
    - title: "The message from the user will be processed using natural language processing to create a query for the Spot Market engine"

  id: 3
  functions:
    - title: "The bot is built using Microsoft Bot Framework and deployed as a web service which can be connected to various channels (such as Sype or Telegram)"
    - title: "Messages sent by the user are received by the bot and processed using natural language processing to create a query for the Spot Market engine"
    - title: "A response is sent to the user based on the results returned by the engine, for example a carousel or action buttons"

  id: 4
  functions:
    - title: "A unique key is formed from the platform the user is on and their id on that platform"
    - title: "The unique key is used to query the account database to return the profile information for Spot Market engine"
    - title: "When the bot queries Spot Market engine on behalf of the user their profile information is attached to provide personalised results based on the machine learning"
    - title: "If the unique key does not exist in the database an account is created using the Spot Market engine API and the returned profile data is stored in the account database with the unique key"
  tests:
    - title: "If the user is recognised they will be associated with the profile on the Spot Market engine"
    - title: "If the user is not recognised an account is created on the Spot Market engine"

  id: 5
  functions:
    - title: "When the natural language processing model returns the intent as being to link the account the bot will ask for the account details"
    - title: "The account details provided by the user are used to form a unique key to query the database to check the account exists, if it does not the process cancels and returns an error to the user"

  id: 6
  functions:
    - title: "When the natural language processing model returns the intent as being to connect a social media account it prompts for the account information, which depending on the platform could use a login dialogue"
    - title: "If the login dialogue does not check the account exists, the social media service they provide details for is queried using APIs to check the account they provided exists"
    - title: "The bot sends a message to the user with action buttons to prompt the user to confirm the account details are correct"
    - title: "The social media information is sent to the Spot Market engine with the profile associated with the user"
