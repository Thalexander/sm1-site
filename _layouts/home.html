      <h3>Project Description</h3>
      <p>
		 Our project is to utilise technologies such as Cortana, 
         Intelligence Suite and Microsoft Bot Framework to create a simple
         and powerful interface for the Spot Market engine. We are working 
         to create a proof of concept for this but to best meet the needs of
         the project we are carrying out a number of experiments to research 
         how best to create the interface.
