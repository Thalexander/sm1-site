                <p>We encountered a number of issues over the course of the project, here we list the key challenges we faced and how we overcame them.</p>

                <h3><b>Spot Market engine</b></h3>
                <p>The Spot Market engine we were provided could not be deployed according to its instructions, we spent a considerable amount of time trying to fix it, as desired by our clients. Whilst we were trying to fix it we based our research and development off dummy functions that outlined what we were told it was capable of, to allow us to continue making progress. Eventually we reached a conclusion that we would not be able to get the engine working and so we built a dummy api that matched to as large an extent as possible the api, but extended to meet the requirements of our bot. We found that the api was very limited, however we organised a meeting with the students working on redesigning the api and ensured our extensions and implementations would conform to the design of theirs.</p>
