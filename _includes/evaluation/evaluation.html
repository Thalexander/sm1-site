                <p>This section will focus on evaluating various components of the system we created.</p>

                <h3><b>Architecture Design</b></h3>
                <p>
                <br />
                <h3><b>User Experience</b></h3>
                <p>
                <br />
                <h3><b>Functionality</b></h3>
                <p>
                <br />
                <h3><b>Stability</b></h3>
                <p>
                <br />
                <h3><b>Efficiency</b></h3>
                <p>
                <br />
                <h3><b>Compatibility</b></h3>
                <p>By using Microsoft Bot framework rather than directly using the apis of the various instant messaging services, we can support a large array of different messaging platforms. As a result of our research and choosing this framework, we have great compatibility.</p>
                <br />
                <h3><b>Maintainability</b></h3>
                <p>The bot is highly maintainable as it uses a single api that is maintained by Microsoft and has a single code base to traget multiple platforms as opposed to different bots for each platform if we had used their individual apis.</p>
                <br />
                <h3><b>Evaluation of Testing</b></h3>
                <p>We did not follow test driven development, however we did use testing in some cases to ensure the system operated as expected. Whilst our code is quite minimal so we can be quite confident that it will operate as expected, we hsould have followed a test-driven development methodology, such that we can be very confident in its behaviour.</p>
