                <br />
                <p>This section will focus on evaluating various components of the system we created.</p>
                <hr />
                <br />
                <h3><b>Architecture Design</b></h3>
                <p>By separating our system into independent components we have made it easier to maintain as the interactions between them are planned, and we can modify the implementation details easily without breaking it, on the downside as we use REST requests to communicate between them a typical interaction would involve 2 requests internally which may have a negative impact on performance if the connection between them is not fast enough.</p>
                <br />
                <h3><b>User Experience</b></h3>
                <p>We allow people to talk to the bot using natural language, as a result the usage of the bot is quite intuitive as they merely have to specify what they want to do. A downside of this however is worse discoverability of what they can do with it, although we have added help dialogs to mitigate this.</p>
                <br />
                <h3><b>Functionality</b></h3>
                <p>We have been able to meet all of the MoSCoW requirements that we defined, however since we do not have a working version of the Spot Market engine we cannot offer the machine learning capabilities. As a result of our efforts to match their api though it should not require much work to port the bot over to their api when it is finished.</p>
                <br />
                <h3><b>Stability</b></h3>
                <p>We have not had any issues with the stability of the bot</p>
                <br />
                <h3><b>Efficiency</b></h3>
                <p>As the client side of the bot is handled by their messaging platform of choice, we can offer much greater efficiency than if we had developed our own application. On the backend we are also highly efficient due to our use non-blocking IO by developing it using node.js.</p>
                <br />
                <h3><b>Compatibility</b></h3>
                <p>By using Microsoft Bot framework rather than directly using the apis of the various instant messaging services, we can support a large array of different messaging platforms. As a result of our research and choosing this framework, we have great compatibility.</p>
                <br />
                <h3><b>Maintainability</b></h3>
                <p>The bot is highly maintainable as it uses a single api that is maintained by Microsoft and has a single code base to target multiple platforms as opposed to different bots for each platform if we had used their individual apis.</p>
                <br />
                <h3><b>Evaluation of Testing</b></h3>
                <p>We did not follow test driven development, however we did use testing in some cases to ensure the system operated as expected. Whilst our code is quite minimal so we can be quite confident that it will operate as expected, we should have followed a test-driven development methodology, such that we can be very confident in its behaviour.</p>
                <br />
                <h3><b>Project Management</b></h3>
                <p>We have followed agile methodologies to manage the project, however we were significantly delayed by the issues with Spot Market engine, which resulted in one member of the team having to focus a lot of time on understanding the non-functional code and creating a dummy api to replicate it. As a result of our use of Visual Studio Team Services we were always clear on who was responsible for which tasks and work was fairly divided.</p>
