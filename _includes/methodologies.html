                <p>During the process of development we decided to </p>
                <p><b><em>Waterfall</em></b>: This type of development methodology requires the developer to initially create a set of deadlines and linearly more towards the end goal. There is no flexibility in terms of iterating any process or changing the set of initial requirements. </p>
                <p><b><em>Agile</em></b>: Agile is one of the most famous software development methodologies. The basis of Agile is on iteration and all of the engineering planning such as requirements can evolve during the process of development. By this means, you can get a disciplined and </p>
                <p><b><em>Scrum</em></b>: Scrum is a specific type of Agile development. In scrum, the iteration mainly goes through specific sprints which are sections of development through . It is great for younger teams who have never worked with any software engineering methodology before, and is the most widely used methodology in general.</p>
                <p><b><em>Kanban</em></b>: Kanban, like Scrum, is another type of Agile development. The key difference with the other two methodologies mentioned is that Kanban visualises the process of development and has a smaller amount of work in progress at a time.</p><br>
                <p>Our decision was to use the <b>Scrum</b> methodology, mainly because</p>

                  <li>It is supported by VSTS which is our main software engineering tool.</li>
                  <li>It is beginner friendly and helpful for our small team.</li>
