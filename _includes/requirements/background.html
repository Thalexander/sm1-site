                <p>Spot Market is an ambitious project to rejuvenate highstreets which in recent years have been in decline as well as help to connect consumers and retailers to mutual benefit in a secure and private manner.</p><p>Spot Market allows users to find what they are looking for and get recommendations using advanced machine learning techniques to save hassle and speed up shopping! We are working with <em>Microsoft</em> and <em>Kent County Council</em> to realise these aims. In order to further the project we are creating this bot to experiment with new ways of interacting with the Spot Market Engine. <b>We hope you like what we are creating!</b></p>
