                <p>The Microsoft Spot Market ChatBot will be a proof of concept bot
                   that can be used by consumers to search for and be recommended
                   products and deals without having to install a client app, you
                   can connect by talking to the bot on your messenging platform
                   of choice. The bot will provide customised recommendations
                   through advanced machine learning techniques implemented by the
                   Microsoft Spot Market Engine, which will over time learn what
                   products you are interested in and if you grant it access to
                   your social media accounts, it can better help you find the
                   products you want.
